Lazy Landscapes
===============

Web app for making web apps

The description

Installation instructions
-------------------------

This is a Django application, so you might want to install Django first

Then:
- Install django-reversion <https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion>
- In lazylandscape directory: `python manage.py syncdb`
- In lazylandscape directory: `python manage.py runserver`

And you're done

Note
-----------------------
By re-implementing LL as a Django application, I almost gave up on the PHP "backend"
